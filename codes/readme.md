## Code for "Object Detection and Classification: A Selection and Fusion Strategy of Deep Convolutional Neural Network and SIFT Point Features "

## How to Run the Code ?

## Local Feature :
SIFT point featre are extracted in the first phase of code.

## Deep Learning Model 1: 
This section of feature extraction will use Alexnet deep learning model for feature extraction.


## Deep Learning Model 2 : 

This section of feature extraction will use VGG19 deep learning model for feature extraction.
